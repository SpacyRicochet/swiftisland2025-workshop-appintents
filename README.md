This is the workshop given at Swift Island 2025 about App Intents, centered around Interactive Intents.

> [!TIP] 
> This is a Git LFS enabled project, to facilitate the large blobs for the presentation content.

### Overview

The workshop aims to give an introduction to the Interactive Snippets, which are new in iOS 26 for App Intents. We aim to take you from making more beautiful views for your intents, to making the intent interactive and creating a more complex workflow for adding content to your entities.

### Repository

#### Workshop projects

The repository has three main steps, which have both a starting point and a `done` version, alongside an initial prep to check if everyone can follow along.

* `0-prep`: The preparation project, which participants can run for the 'Open favorites' example.
* `1-create-snippet-view`: The first project, where we create a snippet view.
	* `1-create-snippet-view-done`: The solved project for step 1.
* `2-toggle-favorite`: The second project, where we modify the snippet view to be interactive and toggle a landmark's favorite status.
	* `2-toggle-favorite-done`: The solved project for step 2.
* `3-add-visit`: The third project, where we create a wizard App Intent that allows us to add a visit to a landmark, alongside a log.
	* `3-create-snippet-view-done`: The solved project for step 3.

#### Presentation

The `presentation` folder provides `Slides.pdf`, which is an exported version of the Keynote presentation. As such, movies will not play, but they are described in a separate slide. The movies are available as separate files in the folder as well.
